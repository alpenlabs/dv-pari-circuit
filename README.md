This repo includes binary circuit representation of DV-Pari verifier program designed for low number of AND gates -- currently around 11 million.

A verifier program is built from the following functions represented as circuits:
- Base Field Multiplication
- Scalar Field Multiplication
- Curve Operations
- Blake3 Hash Operation

User operations:
- At setup time, compile the circuit and export it to a format (like bristol)
- At runtime, evaluate the circuit for a given bit stream

Compilation and evaluation currently takes around 13 minutes with 9 GB of peak memory.
